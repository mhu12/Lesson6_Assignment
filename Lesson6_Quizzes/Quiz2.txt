Questions:

1.  Name two methods you can use to add a node to the DOM tree, and explain the difference between them.

    Two methods you can use to add a node to the Dom Tree are:

        appendChild()
        insertBefore()

The appendChild() node will append after every child node while the insertBefore() 
function would let me designate the order of any inserted node amongst all the other child nodes.

 The Document, frames, history, location, navigator and screen.
